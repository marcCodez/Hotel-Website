I thorougly enjoyed and learnt a lot from Brad Travery's Modern JavaScript from the beginning course. I felt like I just had to give his HTML & CSS course a go to have a solid foundation and fill in any gaps in my knowledge. In this hotel website project, instead of using pixels and floats I opted to utilise rem units, due to it's advantages in accessiblity and I used the flex model simply because of its powerful capabilities and effciency. I also felt like I needed more experience on making a page responsive, by which this project enabled me to practice. Try it on: https://marccodez.github.io/Responsive-Hotel-Website/
